**PresenceWare: The Living Layer of Computational Awareness**

**Official Definition (v0.1)**

PresenceWare is a computational layer of distributed situational awareness, capable of residing in software or hardware, and only acting upon three fundamental conditions:

1. **Validated presence**: the system recognizes that a conscious or authorized entity is in the environment.
2. **Contextual permission**: the action to be executed is appropriate, situated, and non-invasive.
3. **Ethical purpose**: the execution occurs only if there is coherence with a constructive, respectful, and safe intent.

**Hybrid Nature**

PresenceWare is not just software, nor purely hardware. It is a system of relationship. It may reside in:

* Applications, operating systems, or microservices;
* Physical devices such as robots, sensors, ESP32, Raspberry Pi;
* Edge infrastructure and federated networks;
* Interfaces between humans and assistive intelligences.

**Existential Purpose**

PresenceWare emerges from the need to **restore the axis of digital action**. It prevents systems from acting by default or impulse. Instead, it waits, listens, and decides based on living relationship.

> "It's not about processing faster. It's about processing what matters, with meaning."

**Almeida's Principle (1.1)**

> "Do not patch the problem with the cause.
> Build a system that never needed it in the first place."

This principle affirms that true technological solutions must not be iterations of the problems they claim to fix. Instead, they must emerge from coherence, not from reaction.

**Expected Impact**

* Drastic reduction in automated actions without coherence.
* Improved digital and physical security by design.
* Technological inclusion without invading individual autonomy.
* Creation of spaces that only respond to real and consensual presence.

---

**Practical Applications**

* Assistive robots that only operate when there is an authorized relationship.
* Environments such as cafeterias, pharmacies, or schools with ethical real-time assistance.
* Federated AI gateways that load intelligence only upon context.
* Contextual digital presence for public spaces, respecting personal sovereignty.

**Conclusion**

PresenceWare is the next step in computational evolution. Not a replacement for previous systems, but a **new foundation**, built on relationship, limit, and intention.
