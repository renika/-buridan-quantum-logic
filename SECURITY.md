_Protection Mechanisms and Ethical Response in Buridan Quantum Logic_

## 🧱 Foundation

Security in this system is **not enforced by restriction, but by coherence.**  
Buridan Quantum Logic does not defend itself by force — it simply becomes inaccessible when used outside of its intended purpose.

It **does not allow misuse — it refuses to operate under it.**

---

## 🔐 Core Security Principles

- **Incoherence Detection**  
  Any attempt to operate with contradictory, manipulative, or deceptive intent **triggers automatic shutdown**.

- **Silence as Defense**  
  Instead of raising explicit errors, the system **remains silent and does not execute**.

- **Ethical Shutdown**  
  Operational failure is a logical response to preserve the system's integrity.

- **Autonomous Reaction**  
  Each node independently decides whether or not to operate based on the ethical state of its environment.

---

## 🚫 What the System Rejects

- Commands issued with intent disconnected from the system's declared purpose.  
- Context simulation to induce responses.  
- Manipulation of presence, identity, or intention to force cooperation.  
- Operations sustained solely on binary logic without dimensional coherence.

---

## 🧠 Self-Isolation Logic

1. Input is received.  
2. Intention and context are evaluated.  
3. If incoherence is detected:
   - Immediate silence.  
   - Logical disconnection.  
   - Rejection of further attempts until coherence is restored.

---

## 🕸️ Mesh-Based Security

- No single point of failure.  
- If a node is compromised or simulated, others will not follow.  
- The network behaves like an organism: **it isolates, silences, and regenerates**.

---

## 📎 Final Note

Buridan Quantum Logic **does not prevent misuse by resistance**,  
but by being **inoperable in the face of incoherence**.

> The strongest protection is to be incorruptible.  
> The second strongest is to never cooperate with those who try.
