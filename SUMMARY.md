⚙️ Real-World Implementation

This logic is not theoretical. It is actively deployed in the ManyOne + Trafega platform:

- Running on low-cost hardware: ESP32, Raspberry Pi Zero.
- Deployed in clinics, local commerce, neighborhoods, and rural areas.
- Enables fallback AI systems with ethical gating and presence-based activation.
- Operates autonomously, even without constant internet access.
- Reinforces human dignity through intentional, decentralized computation.
