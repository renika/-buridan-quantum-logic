# 🧠 Architecture of Hidden Systems

A universal detection model based on **data overlay structures** — applicable to money laundering, reputation laundering, disinformation campaigns, cartel simulation, and identity manipulation.

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents a **framework developed by Renê Luiz de Almeida** that formalizes how hidden systems operate through a tri-phased structure:
1. **Insertion** – Entry into a legitimate or neutral interface.
2. **Dispersal** – Strategic fragmentation across layers, networks, or identities.
3. **Convergence** – Reassembly of value, power, or legitimacy at a later point.

The concept was inspired by packet encapsulation in computer networks and applied to both **technical** and **sociopolitical** detection.
