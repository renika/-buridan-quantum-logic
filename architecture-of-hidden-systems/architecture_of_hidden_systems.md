## Abstract

This document formalizes a universal detection model based on the logic of **data overlay structures**. Originally applied to money laundering detection, this model reveals itself as a powerful tool for identifying **hidden systemic behaviors** where intent is deliberately fragmented and reassembled for legitimacy or deception.

---

## Foundational Principle

A hidden system typically follows this structure:

1. **Insertion** – Initial appearance in a legitimate context.
2. **Dispersal** – Distribution of actions, data, or influence in fragmented, low-visibility units.
3. **Convergence** – Reassembly of power, money, or legitimacy in another place, masked by structural complexity.

This pattern mimics network data encapsulation (as in VPN or TOR) and is used in both technical and social systems to disguise origin and intent.

## PatternMap: Use Cases of Overlaid Behavior

### 🧠 1. Reputation Laundering

**Use:** Build fake credibility through distributed media/influence.

* Insertion: First media placement or staged partnership.
* Dispersal: Amplification via influencers, paid media, bots.
* Convergence: Award, institutional support, or legitimacy.

➡ **Detected via:** pattern of coordinated dissemination and post-impact benefits.

---

### 🗳️ 2. Electoral Manipulation

**Use:** Alter public opinion or voting through layered campaigns.

* Insertion: Anonymous donations, subtle content seeding.
* Dispersal: Ad targeting, meme spread, micro-influencer waves.
* Convergence: Perception shift, policy change, or election result.

➡ **Detected via:** influence pattern graphs + time-series narrative shifts.

---

### 🏦 3. Corporate Cartel Simulation

**Use:** Simulate free-market behavior among co-owned entities.

* Insertion: Registration of shell companies with distinct identities.
* Dispersal: Alternating bid wins, intercompany invoicing.
* Convergence: Profits consolidated in a single holding.

➡ **Detected via:** contract rotation patterns + ownership graph analysis.

---

### 🌐 4. Coordinated Disinformation Campaigns

**Use:** Craft and spread narratives by diverse-looking agents.

* Insertion: Initial content injection.
* Dispersal: Reposts, forum seeds, WhatsApp group shares.
* Convergence: Perception shaping, ideological activation.

➡ **Detected via:** NLP-based semantic trail + simultaneous activation.

---

### 👤 5. Identity Overlay (Personal or Corporate)

**Use:** Reuse or rotate legal identities while keeping same operator.

* Insertion: New identity (CPF/CNPJ).
* Dispersal: Decentralized operations, multiple accounts.
* Convergence: Benefits return to original controller.

➡ **Detected via:** behavioral biometrics, device usage, geographic heatmaps.

## Practical Framework

Each detected system can be mapped to the three-phase overlay:

| Phase       | Function                               | Indicators                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Insertion   | Entry into system with plausible cover | Recent creation, clean history, legit interface   |
| Dispersal   | Activity masking origin or linkage     | Multiple targets, timing patterns, noise layering |
| Convergence | Harvesting results with minimal trace  | Asset purchase, media legitimacy, decision change |

## Tools for Detection

* **Graph Theory Tools** (e.g. Neo4j, Gephi)
* **Natural Language Processing** (for disinfo and reputation signals)
* **Time-Series Intelligence**
* **AI/ML Behavioral Clustering**
* **Metadata & Device Fingerprinting**

## Final Consideration

> "What is legal in isolation may be criminal in structure."

This architecture allows investigators, auditors, regulators, and even AI systems to understand that truth does not reside in single events, but in how parts connect and converge.

We are not only detecting crimes — we are mapping architectures of intention.
