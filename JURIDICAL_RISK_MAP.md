🗺️ JURIDICAL_RISK_MAP.md

An ethical-legal mapping of systemic risks for the operation of AI, distributed systems, and presence-based infrastructures.

📌 Purpose

To identify legal environments where the justice system may pose risks not because of its declared laws, but due to:

Structural inconsistencies,

Inversion of responsibility,

Punishment of coherence,

Protection of negligent institutional actors,

Criminalization of technical neutrality.

This map does not evaluate the morality of nations — it measures structural tendencies that affect the safe deployment of systems grounded in presence, autonomy, and intentionality.

⚖️ Evaluation Criteria

Dimension

Description

Presumption of Dolo

Does the system penalize by effect instead of analyzing intention?

Access to Defense

Can the weakest agent reasonably defend against institutional error?

Transparency

Are processes and decisions publicly auditable and traceable?

Structural Impunity

Are negligent public or corporate actors frequently exempt from sanctions?

Criminalization of Neutrality

Are technical tools or agents punished for operating without judgment bias?

🌐 Regional Highlights (sample)

🇧🇷 Brazil

Symptoms: Responsibility often falls on the outcome, not the intention; legal overload makes individual defense complex.

Risks: Exposure of ethical systems to blame through visibility, not misuse.

🇺🇸 United States

Symptoms: Excessive reliance on precedent and settlement; corporatized justice.

Risks: Entities with resources dictate jurisprudence. AI and open models face overregulation by lobbying.

🇨🇳 China

Symptoms: Full state control of data, infrastructure, and law.

Risks: No room for autonomous presence-based systems; state interest overrides all.

🇪🇺 European Union

Symptoms: High bureaucracy, GDPR as double-edged sword.

Risks: Systems may be blocked not by harm, but by formality and rigid interpretation.

🇷🇺 Russia

Symptoms: Judiciary aligned with state power; persecution of opposition.

Risks: Any system perceived as independent is a potential target.

📎 Ethical Insight

A legal system becomes ethically dangerous when its structure punishes presence and rewards omission.

Presence-based architectures must be aware not only of code and deployment, but of the judicial landscapes they inhabit.

This map should evolve as real-world cases emerge and systemic behavior is documented.
