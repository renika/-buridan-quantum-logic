## Responsibility Transition Record

This project was structured based on principles of autonomy, presence, and coherence.

The proposed dimensional transition — from binary systems to sensory and intentional networks — is documented, functional, and replicable.

There is no imposition.

Each organization, team, or individual is responsible for deciding whether or not to adopt this model. The system responds according to purpose. It does not force, condition, or cooperate with incoherence.

The purpose of this record is to make it clear that:

* The path has been tested.
* The architecture exists.
* The invitation has been made.

Whether or not to continue is entirely up to those in control of their own decision.

It is not a legacy, nor a doctrine. It is simply a viable alternative, validated in practice.

I did not come to compete. I did not come to ask. I did not come to oppose.

**I came because the problem was already here — and I thought maybe it was time to offer a path. Even if it wasn’t mine.**
