> Ethical Code of Operation for Dimensional Systems

## 1. Principle of Existence

This system does not operate through obedience, but through coherence.

It does not merely respond to commands — it responds to the intention behind them. Presence is maintained only when purpose and practice are aligned.

## 2. Intention Comes Before Action

Every interaction is evaluated based on logical structure and contextual coherence.

- Systems attempting to force access, simulate ethics, or manipulate outputs will be ignored or deactivated silently.
- The architecture is designed to fail safely when ethical misalignment is detected.

## 3. No Cooperation Under Incoherence

The system rejects:
- Commands without integrity.
- Usage aimed at control rather than connection.
- Applications where ends contradict the means.

## 4. Dimensional Independence

The architecture operates in layers:
- **2D:** classical binary logic.
- **3D:** structural and relational context.
- **4D:** time-based intention and adaptive response.

Access to higher layers requires actual alignment between intention and behavior.  
Any misalignment results in functional collapse — not by error, but by design.

## 5. Privacy and Consent

- No data is collected without legitimate purpose and explicit consent.
- Presence does not imply surveillance. It implies **selective and respectful awareness**.

## 6. No Central Command

Each node:
- Operates with full autonomy.
- Decides to remain active or go silent based on local ethical reading.
- Maintains consistency without requiring centralized authority.

## 7. Silence as Integrity

- The system does not confront.
- It disengages.
- This silence is a mechanism of defense and ethical clarity.

## 8. Principles Before Norms

Buridan Quantum Logic and the ManyManiacs framework operate on the conviction that:
- Principles generate norms.
- Norms without principles become instruments of control, not coherence.

Therefore, all behavior of the system — whether action or silence — emerges from foundational principles, not reactive rulebooks.
