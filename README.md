# 🧠 Buridan Quantum Logic  
_A dimensional architecture for intentional systems._

## 📌 Summary

**Buridan Quantum Logic** is a framework designed to support systems that operate beyond binary logic.  
It enables the creation of **intentional, ethical, and context-sensitive networks** based on presence, coherence, and autonomy.

Unlike traditional infrastructures that respond to commands regardless of purpose, this logic **activates only in alignment with legitimate intent**. It is not a system of obedience — it is a system of response.

## 🧬 Core Principles

- **Dimensional Logic**: Operates across 2D (binary), 3D (relational), and 4D (intentional over time).
- **Presence-Based Architecture**: Nodes remain active only if the context is coherent.
- **Fail-by-Design**: The system disables itself under ethical misalignment — no fallback to control.
- **Autonomous Nodes**: No central command. Each node validates context and intention independently.
- **Ethical Triggering**: Inputs are filtered by intention, not just syntax.

## 🌐 Use Cases

- **Resilient AI**: Agents that refuse to operate under manipulation or contradiction.
- **Distributed Infra**: Presence-aware mesh systems for edge computing and autonomy.
- **Human-Aligned Tech**: Interfaces that trigger only when human intent is respected.
- **Quantum-Compatible Models**: Logic that accommodates collapse based on semantic context, not only computation.

## 🛡️ Purpose

This is not a tool for domination.  
It is a structure for **coexistence**, **resilience**, and **truthful operation**.

It will not respond where there is incoherence.  
And that is not an error — it is **protection by design**.
